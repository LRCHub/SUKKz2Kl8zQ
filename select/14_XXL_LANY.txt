All my favorite songs are from 2018
We flew around the world with our small-town dreams
You're a superstar and you wear it so well
But nothin' like you in my hoodie, double-XL

Bloodstream
Full of desert lightnin'
Thank God I'm not drivin'
A blur the whole way home

I still remember
I will forever
Backseat secrets we won't ever tell
I miss you, double-XL
Miss Americana
And all my friends love ya
Back patio at the Bowery Hotel
I miss you, double-XL

You've been goin' out in the glitter and glow
Hollywood fades and it's startin' to show
I'm barely hangin' on and I'm lookin' for help
Every night without you hurtin', double-XL

Bloodstream
Full of desert lightnin'
Thank God I'm not drivin'
A blur the whole way home (yeah)

I still remember
I will forever
Backseat secrets we won't ever tell
I miss you, double-XL
Miss Americana
And all my friends love ya
Back patio at the Bowery Hotel
I miss you, double-XL

Baby, we'll always have California
Half of me will always be waitin' for ya

I still remember
I will forever
Backseat secrets we won't ever tell
I miss you, double-XL
Miss Americana
And all my friends love ya
Back patio at the Bowery Hotel
I miss you, double-XL

Baby, we'll always have California
Half of me will always be waitin' for ya
Baby, we'll always have California
Half of me will always be waitin' for ya (I miss you, double-XL)
